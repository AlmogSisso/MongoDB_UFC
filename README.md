# MongoDB_UFC
A comprehensive MongoDB project showcasing advanced database operations on independently created UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) data.


# Final Project in MongoDB: UFC Data Management System

This project is a culminating assignment for the MongoDB course, where we created a complex database and implemented advanced queries. The project focuses on the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) organization, with the database being independently created by us.

## Project Components:

1. **Planning and Specification**: We performed Data Modeling for UFC data, including decisions on the Database structure with a combination of Embedded and Referenced collections.

2. **Database Setup**: We created a database and collections representing various aspects of the UFC (such as fighters, fights, weight categories, etc.), and inserted documents into each collection using commands like `insertOne` and `insertMany`.

3. **Data Creation**: We independently created and collected all the necessary data for the UFC database.

4. **JSON Usage**: We wrote code and functions in JSON for various project needs, tailored to UFC data.

5. **Data Search and Retrieval**: We used the `find` method with various arguments such as `limit()`, `skip()`, `count()`, `sort()`, `toArray()`, and `foreach()` to analyze UFC data.

6. **Updates and Deletions**: We performed duplication, deletion, and updating of data using operators like `$set`, `$addToSet`, `$inc`, `$pop`, `$push`, `$pull`, simulating real scenarios in UFC data management.

7. **Aggregate Usage**: We created complex queries for calculations, cross-sections, processing, and accumulations using the `aggregate` method, for example, to analyze fighter performances or fight statistics.

8. **MapReduce Usage**: We used the `mapReduce` method for mapping and reducing large datasets and performing accumulations, for instance, to analyze trends over time in the UFC organization.

This project demonstrates an in-depth ability to work with MongoDB, including database design, data management, and complex query execution, while focusing on real and interesting data from the world of UFC.
